## Overview

Morph allows you to transition seamlessly between two or more SVG shapes. Draw any solid shape on the Canvas, connect their Graphic containers to the Morph component, and preview to start animating. Customize delays, loops, duration, pauses between morphs and more. Use any spring or easing curve included within Framer Motion.
