## Overview

Create beautiful **easing gradients** with custom curves in either RGBA, HSL or HUSL Color Models. Similar to [James Daniel’s](https://packages.framer.com/package/rakujira/easing-gradients) Package—except this one’s built from scratch using Framer’s Color Mix Models instead of Chroma, which means it also supports [HUSL](http://www.hsluv.org/). Plus, it allows for custom bezier curves to represent the gradients, giving you complete creative control.
