FirebaseData allows you to seamlessly create and store variables in your prototype that sync in real time across multiple devices and sessions.

## Contents
- Tutorial Components for creating a functional chat app in Framer with FirebaseData
- The `firebase-data` package that makes it all possible

With this package, you should have a solid base to create prototypes such as:

- A functional real-time chat
- A to-do list that syncs across devices and sessions
- A controller prototype that controls another prototype

## Troubleshooting

The most common issues in setting up `firebase-data` are related to the Firebase setup process. I've walked through the process as well some common problems & solutions in a [paper document](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Setting-up-Firebase-for-Firebase-Data--AnpLED5WgbSr5k8GTVvHo_IhAg-0oxp4lf7ryemVaeFAJirh).
