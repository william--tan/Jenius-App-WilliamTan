# Overview
The Perspective Hover component is used to give any frame a 3D effect while hovering over it. It uses the [react-tilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tilt) package built by [jonathandion](https://www.npmjs.com/~jonathandion).

## Usage
To apply the hover effect, drag the component onto the canvas, go to the properties panel and select a frame in the tilt element property. You can also connect the component to any frame with the frame connector.

## Properties
- **Tilt Element** Is used to select the frame
- **Tile** max tilt rotation (degrees)
- **Perspective** Transform perspective, the lower the more extreme the tilt gets.
- **Scale** Increases size on hover (e.g. 1.5 = 150%)
- **Reset** If the tilt effect has to be reset on exit.
- **Direction** Changes the tilt direction towards or away
from mouse.
- **Axis** Pick the axis to remain enabled.

## Parallax
To create a parallax effect we can utilize overrides on any inner elements in the connected frame. Add the code below to the override file. 
```
export function E100(): Override {
    return {
        z: 100,
    }
}
```

### Adjust Parallax Level
To change elevation of element for a more dramatic effect update the number
```
z: 30, // Closer
z: 120, // Further
```
