# Overview

A new grid component that allows you to design completely fluid grids. What’s unique is that you can connect multiple frames to populate the grid—each filling their own responsive cell. Easily design adaptive grid with interchangeable, sortable content cells. 

The Cells component is a sibling of the [Grid](https://store.framer.com/package/benjamin/grid) component, which instead renders a single element across all cells, making it more suitable for pairing with randomly-generated data components like the  [Profile](https://store.framer.com/package/benjamin/profile) component.
